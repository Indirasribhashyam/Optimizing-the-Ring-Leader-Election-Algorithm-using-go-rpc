# Optimizing the Ring Leader Election Algorithm using Go RPC

Leader election is an essential operation in distributed systems. This project optimizes the classic Ring Election Algorithm using Goâ€™s concurrency features like goroutines, atomic operations, and channels. It ensures only one election runs at a time, minimizes overhead, and handles failures gracefully.

## Problem Statement

In traditional ring algorithms, the following problems occur:
- Multiple processes may start elections simultaneously.
- Dead or unresponsive processes can cause delays or infinite waits.
- There is no guaranteed mechanism for all processes to acknowledge the leader.

## Description

This project enhances the Ring Leader Election Algorithm to address common issues like:
- Multiple simultaneous elections
- Deadlocks due to non-responsive processes
- Message overhead
- Lack of leader acknowledgment

We leverage Go's atomic operations, channels, and timeout mechanisms to make the election robust and efficient.

## Key Optimizations

**Prevention of Multiple Simultaneous Elections:**
Uses an atomic boolean (electionRunning) to ensure only one election occurs at a time, reducing unnecessary message overhead.

**Failure Handling and Timeout Mechanism:**
Implements a timeout (time.After(3 * time.Second)) to handle process failures and restart elections if no response is received.

**Reduction of Message Overhead:**
Guarantees a single election process to avoid excessive message traffic.

**Leader Acknowledgment and Robustness:**
Introduces leader acknowledgment channels (Leader channels) to ensure all processes receive the leader ID, even if messages are lost.

**Handling Process Failures During Election:**
Utilizes a randomized "alive" status (IsAlive) to skip elections for downed processes.

**Leader Failure Detection and Election Restart:**
Monitors leader status and restarts the election if no leader is detected within 5 seconds.

**Prioritization of Stronger Nodes:**
The first alive process starts the election, and higher IDs have a better chance of winning, prioritizing stronger nodes.

**Deadlock Prevention:**
Implements timeout-based retries to prevent deadlocks and ensure elections complete successfully.

## Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)**: Concurrency, channels, atomic operations
- **Randomization**: Simulate process failures
- **Goroutines**: Parallel execution
- **Standard Library Only**: No external dependencies

## Usage


1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Indirasribhashyam/Optimizing-the-Ring-Leader-Election-Algorithm-using-go-rpc.git
    ```

2. **Change directory to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd Optimizing-the-Ring-Leader-Election-Algorithm-using-go-rpc
    ```

3. **Compile and Run the application:**

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Future Work

* Integrate actual Go RPC between processes.
* Create UI-based visualization of the ring and election progress.
* Extend to dynamic rings (process joins/leaves).
* Add metrics dashboard for election time, retries, etc.
